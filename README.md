# SauceDemoQA

**SauceDemoQA** is a robust, modular, and scalable test automation framework for browser-based UI testing.  
It uses **Python**, **Selenium WebDriver**, and **PyTest**, and is built around the **Page Object Model** for clean test logic separation.

This project runs automated tests against the demo e-commerce site:  
[https://www.saucedemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com)
